# NY_Citibike_Usage

## Background

Bike sharing programs have become popular in many major cities like NY and with bike sharing data we can see how well the program would do in other cities. The NY Citibike Share data has insights about users and their habit of bike riding. Using this data can help us determine when and where to make bikes available for maximum usage and profitability. We can apply what we have learned to establishing the program in other metropolotain cities.

## Results

The full results can be found in the following [link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roxane.brown/viz/NYCCitiBikeShareData/BikeShareUsers?publish=yes)

## Summary

According to the results the bike sharing program would be a great and profitable addition to any city with a larger population. Users who might ordinarily use public transportation for work or coming into the big city are willing to ride bikes instead. It is a fun an easy way to explore the city.
